/**
 * Interface for a pool of {@link Connection}(s) for a single {@link Host}
 * 
 * The interface prescribes certain key features required by clients of this class, such as 
 *      <ol>
 *      <li> Basic connection pool life cycle management such as prime connections (init) and shutdown </li> <br/>
 *      
 *      <li> Basic {@link Connection} life cycle management such as borrow / return / close / markAsDown </li> <br/>
 *      
 *      <li> Tracking the {@link Host} associated with the connection pool. </li> <br/>
 *      
 *      <li> Visibility into the status of the connection pool and it's connections.
 *         <ol>
 *         <li>  Tracking status of pool -  isConnecting / isActive  / isShutdown  </li>
 *         <li>  Tracking basic counters for connections - active / pending / blocked / idle / busy / closed etc </li>
 *         <li>  Tracking latency scores for connections to this host.  </li>
 *         <li>  Tracking failures for connections to this host. </li>
 *         </ol> 
 *     </ol>
 *     
 * This class is intended to be used within a collection of {@link HostConnectionPool} tracked by a
 * {@link ConnectionPool} for all the {@link Host}(s) within a Dynomite cluster.
 * 
 * @see {@link ConnectionPool} for references to this class.
